How to add real 3D models
1. Get the files
The plan calls for free CC0 models. Download these:

Quaternius Ultimate Animated Animals — bunny, fox, deer, bird, frog (CC0)
Kenney Nature Kit — trees, rocks, mushrooms, bushes (CC0)
Poly Pizza — search "dragon", "unicorn", "cottage" (CC-BY, free)
All come as .glb or .gltf. If you get .gltf + textures, convert to a single .glb using gltf.report (drag & drop → Export GLB).

2. Put them in the right folders

public/models/
  animals/    bunny.glb  fox.glb  deer.glb  bird.glb  frog.glb
  characters/ lisa.glb
  props/      carrot.glb  crown.glb  gem.glb  twig.glb
  environment/ tree.glb  rock.glb  mushroom.glb  bush.glb  flower.glb
  house/      cottage.glb
  
3. Use them in code
The loadModel function in src/engine.js is already wired up — it takes a path relative to public/models/:


const gltf = await loadModel('animals/bunny.glb');
const mesh = gltf.scene.clone();
mesh.position.set(2, 0, 1);
scene.add(mesh);
For animated models, hook up the mixer:


import { mixers } from './engine.js';

const gltf = await loadModel('animals/bunny.glb');
const mesh = gltf.scene.clone();
const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(mesh);
const idleClip = THREE.AnimationClip.findByName(gltf.animations, 'Idle');
if (idleClip) mixer.clipAction(idleClip).play();
mixers.add(mixer);
scene.add(mesh);
4. Where to swap out placeholders
The placeholder geometry lives in two places:

NPCs → src/npcs.js — createNPCMesh(def) function. Replace with await loadModel(...) and the def object already has an area and pos for placement.
Environment props (trees, rocks, house) → src/areas.js — each area's layout array has entries like { type: 'tree', pos: [...] } where the geometry is built inline. Swap those for loadModel calls.
Lisa herself → src/player.js — createPlaceholderFairy() at line 17.
Quick priority order
If you want to do one at a time, I'd suggest:

Lisa (she's on screen constantly — biggest visual impact)
NPCs (bunny, etc.)
House/cottage exterior
Environment props (trees last since they're decorative)
